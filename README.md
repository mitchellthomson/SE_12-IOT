## SE_12 Code University IOT project
### Digital-Kicker

A student project from Code. Created a prototype to digitalize a physical kicker table

Using arduinos with gyroscope,accelerometer and ultra sonic sensors to track the movement of each "player pole" and then send the data given into a game made with Unity

This proved a cheap and effective way to build the full scale prototype and showcase it for the other students
